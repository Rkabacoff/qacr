**R** is a wonderful language and platform for data science. Unfortunately, many simple tasks in data preparation, data exploration, machine learning, and data visualization can be more difficult than necessary.  

The goal of the **qacr** package is to provide **convenient statistical functions** for the common data science task we perform every day. Additionally, there are over **two dozen data sets** that can be used for
teaching and self-study.

Why **qacr**? This package is created and maintained by faculty and advanced undergradutes in the [Quantitative Analysis Center](http://qac.wesleyan.edu) (QAC) at Wesleyan University. It just seemed appropriate.

### Installation

You can install this package with the following code:

``` r
if(!require(remotes)){
   install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("rkabacoff/qacr")
```

### Using the package

The easiest way to get started is, appropriately enough, by reading the [**Getting Started**](https://rkabacoff.github.io/qacr/articles/qacr.html) guide. Next, take a look at the
[Documentation](https://rkabacoff.github.io/qacr/reference/index.html). There are also *vignettes* on specific topics.

**Suggestions are always welcome!**
