Based on the William Revelle's comprehensive [psych](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/index.html) package, the `qacr` package provides wrapper functions for simplified input, intuitive output, and easily interpretable graphs, making these techniques more accessible to data analysts new to these forms of analysis.

## Principal Components Analysis

Let's perform a principal components analysis on some ratings data. First we'll import the data into
R.

```{r}
# input data
ratings <- read.csv("https://www.promptcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/EFA.csv")
head(ratings)
```

Next, well create a scree plot of the data.

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6}

# scree plot
scree_plot(ratings)
```

The scree plot suggests two components. In the next step, we'll extract two principal components and rotate them using a *varimax* rotation.

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
# extract 2 principal components
fit.pca <- PCA(ratings, nfactor=2, rotate="varimax")
```

The two components account for 35% of the variance in the original data. Next, we'll plot the pattern matrix as both a table and a bar chart.

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
# plot factor pattern as table
plot(fit.pca)

# plot factor pattern as bar chart
plot(fit.pca, type="bar")
```

Finally, we'll add the component scores to the original data.

```{r}
# save component scores
mydata <- score(ratings, fit.pca)
head(mydata)
```
## Factor Analysis

In this section, the ratings data are re-analyzed using a *maximum likelihood* factor analysis. 

Again, we'll start with a scree plot. A random number seed is set to assure reproducibility.

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# scree plot
set.seed(1234)
scree_plot(ratings, method = "ml")
```

The scree plot suggests two factors. In the next step, we'll extract four factors and rotate them using a *promax* rotation.

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
# extract 4 factors
fit.fa <- FA(ratings, nfactor=4, rotate="promax", fm="ml")
```

The printout includes the factor pattern, the factor structure, and the factor intercorrelations.
The four factors account for 40% of the variance in the original data. Factors 1 and 3 have the hightest correlation (0.37).

Next, we'll plot the pattern matrix as both a table and a bar chart. 

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
# plot factor pattern as table
plot(fit.fa)

# plot factor pattern as bar chart
plot(fit.fa, type="bar")
```

Finally, we'll add the factor scores to the original data.

```{r}
# save component scores
mydata <- score(ratings, fit.fa)
head(mydata)
```
