#' The \code{\link[MASS]{Boston}} data frame was obtained from Venables and Ripley's \code{MASS} package.
#' The data utilize census tracts in the Boston Standard Metropolitatn 
#' Statistical Area in 1970. Two changes have been made from this original
#' dataset. The dollar values for \code{tax} and 
#' \code{medv} have been converted to 2020 US dollars (assuming a 299.4\% 
#' cumulative inflation rate). Additionally, the \code{black} variable has 
#' been transformed from its original metric
#' (1000*(proportion of blacks by town - 0.63)^2) to a simple the proportion
