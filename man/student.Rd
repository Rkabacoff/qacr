\description{
Student math achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools
}
\details{
This data approach student achievement in secondary education of 
two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, 
demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected 
by using school reports and questionnaires. This dataset provides 
regarding the performance in Mathematics. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a 
strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because 
G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and 
G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult 
to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more 
useful (see paper source for more details).
}
\note{
While the original data source provides grades in both Mathematics
and Portuguese, this dataset is bases on math scores alone.
